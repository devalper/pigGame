# pigGame
Another simple beginner practice for JavaScript DOM manipulation.
This is also one of the course projects of <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>.

RULES:
1) <strong>"Active Player"</strong> (with the lighter background color) starts the game by clicking <strong>"ROLL DICE"</strong>.
2) The number rolled will be added to the Active Player's <strong>"Current Score"</strong>.
3) If the Active Player rolls <strong>"1"</strong>, the "Current Score" resets to <strong>"Zero"</strong> and the game turn will <strong>switch</strong> to the next player.
4) If the Active Player clicks <strong>"HOLD"</strong> <em>before</em> rolling "1", total "Current Score" will be <em>added</em> to the player's <strong>"TOTAL SCORE"</strong> and the game turn will <em>switch</em> to the next player.
5) First player who <em>reaches</em> or <em>passes</e> <strong>"100"</strong> WINS the game.

Nice game, enjoy!

P.S.: It's not responsive yet :)
